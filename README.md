# Portfolio project IDATT1003 - Foodwaste reduction app

STUDENT NAME = "Sigurd Andris SÃ¸rengen"

## Project description

This projects was developed as the end assignment used in for the programming course IDATT1003 at
NTNU-Trondheim. The FoodWaste app is more or less a utility that helps people keep track of their
current food situation (e.g. what food they have at hand), as well as incuding some numerous other
features:

**The main features of the app are:**

- A food storage to keep track of the food the user has at hand
    * The food storage keeps track of how much of each grocery is available, their expiration date &
      more.
- A cookbook for recipes
    * In the cookbook you can add a recipe for a dish of your choice.
        * The cookbook keeps track of what food you have in the food storage, and can tell you if
          you can or can't make the dish with the food the user has at hand. This way the program
          can also make suggestions for what recipes to make.
        * You can choose weather or not to include food that is past it's best before date, further
          helping in the fight against food waste.

**Instances of the GroceryInstance class contain the following information:**

- The name of the grocery and the measurement unit most often associated with this type of grocery.
- How much you have of this grocery
- The best before (expiration) date of the given grocery
- The price of the grocery per unit

**Instances of the Recipe class contain the following information**

- The ingredients of the recipe, including approximations for how much of each to use in the recipe.
- A short description of the recipe
- Instructions for how to make the recipe

## Project structure

All source files for classes are stored
in [src/main/java/edu/ntnu/idi/idatt](https://github.com/NTNU-IDI/idatt1003-mappe-2024-siguraso/tree/main/src/main/java/edu/ntnu/idi/idatt)
where they then split up into separate packages. The models package includes the base classes for
groceries as well as recipes, the utils package contains UI utilities, mostly used throughout the
UserInterface class (used to create all text-based menus), which is stored in views. The main class,
here titled 'FoodWasteApp' is stored in the root of
the [src/main/java/edu/ntnu/idi/idatt](https://github.com/NTNU-IDI/idatt1003-mappe-2024-siguraso/tree/main/src/main/java/edu/ntnu/idi/idatt)
directory.

The tests for each of the model classes are stored
in [src/test/java/edu/ntnu/idi/idatt/models](https://github.com/NTNU-IDI/idatt1003-mappe-2024-siguraso/tree/main/src/test/java/edu/ntnu/idi/idatt/models).
